### [Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=tree)

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

A **binary tree's minimum depth** is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```plaintext
    3
   / \
  9  20
     /  \
    15   7
Output:
2
Example 2:
Input:
    2
   /
  3
 /
4
/
5
Output:4
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^5].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
